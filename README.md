# heritage-trust
This is the development of a website for the SCDNR Heritage Trust Program. It is customized from a basic template using boostrap 4. There are a few other things in here besides just bootstrap and the template. 

The live version of this website can be found at [heritagetrust.dnr.sc.gov](http://heritagetrust.dnr.sc.gov)
